# Ad-Categorization-with-Naive-Bayes

This project aims to explore and implement a classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem, specifically the Naive Bayes Classifier. The project focuses on classifying advertisements using this approach along with a Bag of Words Model.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding and practical experience in utilizing the Naive Bayes Classifier, especially in the context of classifying advertisements. The Bag of Words Model will be employed to assist in this classification task.

## Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes Classifier assumes independence among predictors and utilizes Bayes' Theorem to classify data. It is a widely used classification technique in various domains due to its simplicity and efficiency.

## Bag of Words Model

The Bag of Words Model is a common representation technique used in natural language processing and information retrieval. In this project, it will be utilized to preprocess and represent the text data from advertisements.

## Problem Description

The project is based on a dataset containing advertisements from Divar, a platform for posting advertisements. The dataset comprises both a training set (`divar_train.csv`) and a test set (`divar_test.csv`). The goal is to use the Naive Bayes Classifier along with the Bag of Words Model to analyze and categorize these advertisements.
